David Wiese,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"David Wiese joined a marked outflow of South Africa players into county cricket in the 2016-17 season when, at 31, he signed a three-year deal with Sussex, joining his compatriot Stiaan van Zyl. Wiese had not played international cricket since March 2016, and turned down a call-up for a home T20I series against Sri Lanka in making his decision to go Kolpak. "

Pathum Nissanka,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,,Top order Batter,
Kusal Mendis,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
Dhananjaya de Silva,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"A technically correct top-order batsman from the southern reaches of the island, Dhananjaya de Silva briefly caught the national selectors' eye in 2015, then went on to have a bumper domestic season that marked him out for more intensive national duty. De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings. What followed, though, was an emphatic blooming."
Danushka Gunathilaka,Sri Lanka,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"A poised, attacking left-handed opener groomed in part at Sinhalese Sports Club, Danushka Gunathilaka was plucked from the domestic system largely on potential, and drafted into Sri Lanka's A team for the tour of New Zealand in mid-2015. He impressed on that trip, hitting two smart fifties from four innings, to finish as the team's second-highest run-scorer."
Bhanuka Rajapaksa,Sri Lanka,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"An attacking left-handed batsman, Bhanuka Rajapaksa was selected for the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand as one of the team's key batsmen. He lived upto his reputation, by finishing the leading run-scorer for his country with 253 runs. He had an excellent tour of Australia with the U-19 team in 2009, smashing 154 off 111 balls in a one-dayer and ended the series as the leading run-getter. He compares his batting style to Adam Gilchrist. His other sporting interests include squash and swimming.  Cricinfo Staff January 2010"
Dasun Shanaka(c),Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,"A bruising lower-middle order batsman, and an aggressive legbreak bowler, Wanidu Hasaranga graduated from a strong Richmond College outfit, had a fine run in Sri Lanka's 2015 and 2016 Under-19 teams, and has made a promising start to his domestic cricket career."

Pramod Madushan,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,
Dushmantha Chameera,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18."
Maheesh Theekshana,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowler,
Gerhard Erasmus,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,
Bernard Scholtz,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Bernard Scholtz's brother Nicolaas is currently playing for the national side, but Bernard has his chance to impress at the forthcoming Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. His aim, he says, is ""to compete against the top teams of the world and get exposure to a higher level of cricket"". And that goal moved a step closer in 2008 when he was named in the squad to face Bermuda in the Intercontinental Cup. He has represented Namibia A and is interested in becoming an engineer.

Charith Asalanka,Sri Lanka,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,
David Warner,Australia,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Opening Batter,David Warner's extraordinary batting feats in all three formats for Australia will forever be overshadowed by his role as the chief protagonist of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018 and his place as a central figure in Australian cricket's ensuing cultural crisis.
Aaron Finch(c),Australia,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Top order Batter,"A solidly built, aggressive batter from a country town in Victoria, Aaron Finch ascended to become Australia's ODI and T20I captain, leading his country to their first T20 World Cup triumph in 2021. "
Mitchell Marsh,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Part of one of the most well-known family names in Australian cricket, Mitchell Marsh, an allrounder who can hit 140kph and hard-hitting middle-order batsman, has been an alluring prospect for Australia in all three formats but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage."
Glenn Maxwell,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats and, at times, shown he can transfer that to the red ball. It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments."
Marcus Stoinis,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"A powerful, versatile batter and medium-pace bowler, Marcus Stoinis has become a mainstay in Australia's limited-overs sides as well as a dominant player in the BBL and a sought-after player in the IPL. "
Josh Hazlewood,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A tall and accurate fast bowler who is unrelenting in his line and length, Josh Hazlewood became a fixture in Australia's Test attack as soon as he made his debut in December 2014. Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame."
Pat Cummins,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances."
Mitchell Starc,Australia,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."
Ashton Agar,Australia,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Ashton Agar initially turned almost as many heads as he has turned cricket balls. At the age of 19 he had a place in the squads of Western Australia, Perth Scorchers, and the national team, having sensationally been upgraded from an internship on the 2013 tour of India to a more expansive role in Michael Clarke's squad. "
Binura Fernando,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Known for his ability to generate awkward bounce from a height of 6'7"", and swing the ball, Binura Fernando has been among the leading schoolboy-cricket names over the past two years, claiming 84 wickets in the 2013 season. A left-arm seamer, Fernando was called up to Sri Lanka's Test squad during the 2014 home series against Pakistan despite not having played first-class cricket. He was chosen largely on the strength of his performances for DS Senanayake College and the Sri Lanka Under-19 team."
Lahiru Kumara,Sri Lanka,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A robust, right-arm fast bowler from Kandy, Lahiru Kumara had played only eight days of first-class cricket - all of which were for the Sri Lanka A team - before he was selected in the Test squad in October 2016. He was largely picked on his promise. One of the fastest bowlers in Sri Lanka's system, Kumara possesses a sharp bouncer, and an ability to both swing and seam the ball - all allied to a bustling intensity."
Dasun Shanaka,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Regis Chakabva,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A doughty wicketkeeper-batsman, Regis Chakabva's path in cricket took him through Highfields, Churchill, on to Takashinga, provincial cricket and eventually regular appearances in Zimbabwe's Twenty20, ODI and Test teams. At each level, Chakabva has improved his game and he is maturing into a fine batsman and tidy wicketkeeper."
Craig Ervine(c),Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Few people in Zimbabwe cricket circles were surprised when Craig Ervine found his way into Zimbabwe colours. A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion."
Wessly Madhevere,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,
Sean Williams,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Middle order Batter,"Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering."
Sikandar Raza,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Sikandar Raza's story isn't that of your everyday international cricketer. He is not a teenage prodigy, nor is he someone who had a burning ambition to play for his country. He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it."
Milton Shumba,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Top order Batter,
Ryan Burl,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Middle order Batter,"Ryan Burl liked playing squash when he was at school, but his love of cricket - specifically, the team game's camaraderie - made him want to be an international cricketer. A left-hand lower-middle-order batter and occasional legspinner, Burl broke into the Zimbabwe side in 2017, and has also played in the BPL and Afghanistan's Shpageeza Cricket League."
Luke Jongwe,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Paul Stirling,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Paul Stirling has long been recognised as a formidable cricketing talent both in Ireland and beyond. Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket. "
Andy Balbirnie(c),Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"Already one of Ireland's star batters at No. 3, Andrew Balbirnie flourished with the bat even more after he was made captain across formats late in 2019. Although not a power-hitter, Balbirnie is fluent, keeps the score ticking, and is excellent against spin bowling - his hard sweep is a signature shot."
Lorcan Tucker,Ireland,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,
Harry Tector,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,Born into a cricketing family - his brothers Jack and Tim also captained Ireland at U19 World Cups - Harry Tector has quietly amassed an impressive record in the senior side since cementing a spot in the post-Covid era. 
Curtis Campher,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Born in Johannesburg, raised in South Africa and a player for the national Under-19 side, Curtis Campher decided to leave his homeland behind and put his Irish passport to good use in early 2020, declaring his intentions to move to Ireland and play for the national team. He went on the Ireland Wolves' tour to Namibia early that year, and impressed sufficiently to win a place in the squad for a three-match ODI series in England in July."
George Dockrell,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"George Dockrell was identified as a left-arm spinner of rare potential long before he was out of his teens. He made his international debut for Ireland as a 17-year-old in 2010. The accolade was made more remarkable by the fact that he had only been bowling spin for four years, having switched from bowling seam at the age of 13 after coach Brian O'Rourke spotted him bowling spin in a car park during an Ireland age group tour of Wales. "
Gareth Delany,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Batting Allrounder,
Mark Adair,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowling Allrounder,"Mark Adair is a tall, seam-bowling allrounder from Northern Ireland who made his first-class debut for Warwickshire while still a teenager at the end of the 2015 season. From a sporting family - his father was a goalkeeper at a decent level and his brother plays rugby and represented Ireland at cricket at age-group level - Adair also showed promise in rugby but committed to cricket having been offered a trial by Warwickshire in 2013. He has represented Ireland at age-group and A team level and claimed the wicket of Marcus Trescothick as his maiden victim in first-class cricket. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2017 season and has since played for Northern Knights and Durham's second team.

George Dobell"
Simi Singh,Ireland,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak Googly",Bowling Allrounder,
Barry McCarthy,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Barry McCarthy is an Ireland seam bowler whose involvement with Durham owed much to a recommendation by their England allrounder, Ben Stokes, who faced him in the nets before a one-day international and advised his county to take a look. Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015. A maiden five-wicket haul for Durham against Lancashire in Chester-le-Street the following year added to the good impression he had built at Ireland Under-19 level and during a spell with the Australian grade side Randwick-Petersham. "
Josh Little,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A bustling left-arm seamer from Dublin, Josh Little made an immediate impression on ODI debut against England in 2019 when he took 4 for 45 - including the wicket of Eoin Morgan with a sharp bouncer - to leave the world's No. 1-ranked side struggling in an ultimately successful run chase."
Richard Ngarava,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Tendai Chatara,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"The first thing one notices when watching Tendai Chatara bowl is his curiously lopsided action, his left arm almost glued to his side as he rushes through the crease. But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket."
Blessing Muzarabani,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Hazratullah Zazai,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,Afghanistan's ascent up the global rankings from ICC Associate nation to Full Member and Test status has been largely propelled by a conveyor belt of fast bowling and mystery spin. But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,
Ibrahim Zadran,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,
Usman Ghani,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"One of the most exciting new talents to emerge from Afghanistan's cricket programmes in recent years, intrepid opening batsman Usman Ghani was good enough to play one-day international cricket for Afghanistan well before his 18th birthday. Ghani was also good enough to race to a century in his fourth ODI, against Zimbabwe, still aged 17. He started 2014 as part of the Afghanistan Under-19 team that defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in the Under-19 World Cup, and ended it as a member of the squad for Afghanistan's first full World Cup campaign. He warmed up for the tournament with a match-winning hundred against an Auckland team that included Kyle Mills and Mitchell McClenaghan.Liam Brickhill"
Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"
Mohammad Nabi(c),Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan. An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."
Azmatullah Omarzai,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,
Rashid Khan,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. "
Mujeeb Ur Rahman,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowler,"He can bowl traditional offspin and mix it up with legspin and ripping googlies to make what Afghanistan coach Andy Moles terms a ""complete package"". At just 16, Mujeeb wants to follow in the footsteps of Rashid Khan, his senior by two years. There's plenty of hype surrounding him too, supported by the weight of his performances. "
Fareed Ahmad,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Fazalhaq Farooqi,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Jos Buttler(c),England,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and has quickly become a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018."
Alex Hales,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Opening Batter,"Despite a central role in the resurgence of England's limited-overs team following the debacle of the 2015 World Cup, Alex Hales will probably be remembered more for what he missed than what he achieved. He sat out the 2019 World Cup after it emerged he had served a ban for a second drugs test failure for a recreational substance, which seemed to lead the England management and the team's senior players to decide that Hales' behaviour had caused a breakdown of trust between the parties. He was also overlooked for the 2021 T20 World Cup."
Dawid Malan,England,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Top order Batter,"Dawid Malan made a striking entry into international cricket in a T20I in Cardiff in 2017, demolishing South Africa's attack with 78 from 44 balls. He deposited the second ball, from Chris Morris, over midwicket for six and never looked back."
Ben Stokes,England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Allrounder,"The great Irish sports writer Con Houlihan used to say that every team should have a redhead. And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted England to another level. Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins."
Liam Livingstone,England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Batting Allrounder,"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."
Harry Brook,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"A former England U19s captain, Harry Brook announced himself as a player with a bright future with a remarkable T20 Blast season in 2020, averaging 55 and striking at 163 in the group stages despite batting in the middle order."
Moeen Ali,England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann."
Chris Woakes,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Allrounder,"By the time Chris Woakes returned from England's tour to South Africa at the start of 2016, he feared his Test career was over. He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men."
Mark Wood,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"It looked, for a while, as if Mark Wood would be another of those fast bowlers who promised more than they delivered."
Sam Curran,England,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. "
Adil Rashid,England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"Adil Rashid did much to set right English cricket's troubled relationship with legspin when he established himself as the country's leading white-ball spinner in 2015 and four years later was a key part of their World Cup-winning side. At the time of Rashid's recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200."
Mohammad Nabi,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan. An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."

It was quite the birthday present, considering he had not even been capped in internationals for UAE. Suri never suited up for Lions, but he has demonstrated his talents in the time since his UAE international debut, also in 2017, rocketing up the career batting charts to figure among the top five run-makers in both ODIs and T20Is for his country.

Although less heralded at the time, Ackermann was a former South Africa U-19 who had topped the Sunfoil averages in 2016-17, and might have been in contention for a Test call-up had he not taken the well-trodden English county route."
Tom Cooper,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"An aggressive batsman who was born in Wollongong, in New South Wales - the
same coastal city which produced Brett Lee - Tom Cooper now plays his club
cricket for University in Adelaide. An Australian Under-19 representative - he made 104 against South Africa in the 2005-06 Youth World Cup - Cooper broke into the senior South Australian side in November 2008."

Tim Pringle,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,
Logan van Beek,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Logan van Beek is an allrounder in more ways than one. As a cricketer, he compares his play to that of Shane Watson, he also represented New Zealand at the World Under-19 Basketball Championships in 2009, and he works as a sports coach. Named in the New Zealand squad for the Under-19 World Cup in 2010, van Beek is the grandson of Sammy Guillen, who played Test cricket for both West Indies and New Zealand.Cricinfo staff January 2010"
Fred Klaassen,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Spotted as part of a Netherlands development squad which played two one-day friendlies against Kent in 2018, Fred Klaassen joined the county's Second XI, taking nine wickets in two appearances to earn a two-year deal ahead of the 2019 summer. After an impressive debut season for Kent's first team, Klaassen signed a contract extension to keep him at the club at least until the end of 2021."
Paul van Meekeren,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.

Kyle Mayers,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"A left-handed batsman who bowls useful medium pace, Kyle Mayers travelled to England as a reserve for West Indies in 2020 before making his T20I debut in New Zealand later in the year. "
Johnson Charles,West Indies,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A muscular opener with a penchant for swatting the ball square either side of the wicket, much like Dwayne Smith, Johnson Charles was part of West Indies' T20 World Cup winning teams in 2012 and 2016. While Smith's second skill is seam bowling, Charles' is wicketkeeping. With Denesh Ramdin representing West Indies in all three formats, and Andre Fletcher also in the limited-overs mix, West Indies have used Charles' second skill sparingly."
Evin Lewis,West Indies,Left hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"""I hit a lot of sixes, big sixes like him,"" Evin Lewis said when asked why he chose Chris Gayle as his mentor. For an upcoming left-handed opening batsman, especially in the modern game, that's a fairly smart pick."
Brandon King,West Indies,Right hand Bat,,Top order Batter,"Brandon King got his start as a solid middle-order batter for Jamaica before a promotion to the top order in the CPL unlocked his power-hitting potential, and culminated in a call-up to West Indies' white-ball side."
Nicholas Pooran(c),West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Nicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful."
Rovman Powell,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Middle order Batter,"A middle-order batter who bowls occasional medium pace, Rovman Powell has been a semi-regular presence in West Indies' white-ball squads from the mid-2010s without quite nailing down a spot. "

Akeal Hosein,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Akeal Hosein was handed a chance to impress for West Indies in Bangladesh in early 2021 after several senior players opted out of the tour, but his opportunity had been a long time coming. "
Alzarri Joseph,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall fast bowler Alzarri Joseph started out as a legspinner in his backyard in Antigua before his height marked him out for a different style of bowling. In his teens he gained a reputation as one of the fastest bowlers on the school circuit, which carried over into the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, where he bowled the competition's fastest delivery, a 147kph zinger that broke Zimbabwe batter Brendan Sly's stumps. Joseph would finish as West Indies' highest wicket-taker of the tournament, with 13 wickets from six games at an economy of 3.31."
Jason Holder,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"Jason Holder was seen as a future talent until a selection panel headed by former World Cup-winner Clive Lloyd appointed him West Indies' ODI captain in 2014. Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young. "
Mohammad Rizwan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. "
Babar Azam(c),Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"A right-hand, top-order batsman known for his discipline and level-headed attitude, Babar Azam laid claim to a long-term spot in Pakistan's batting line-up with a strong performance in 2016, making three consecutive ODI hundreds against West Indies in the UAE, and a 90 in his third Test, in Hamilton. He was 22 years old at the time."
Shan Masood,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"A solid and technically sound left-hand opener, Shan Masood made it to the international side after impressing consistently at junior-level cricket. With Pakistan struggling to put together a solid opening combination, Masood was the option they turned to in the Test series against South Africa in the UAE."
Iftikhar Ahmed,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,
Shadab Khan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,"A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."
Haider Ali,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,,Middle order Batter,
Mohammad Nawaz,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nawaz started out in cricket at the age of 14 as a left-arm medium-fast bowler and a middle-order batsman. An all-round performance of 60 runs and a four-for for Rawalpindi against Sialkot in an inter-region Under-16 tournament in 2008 earned him a place in the Pakistan side for the International Under-15 Championship in the West Indies. On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. "
Asif Ali,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Where was Asif Ali in the years Pakistan had been crying out for a power hitter? It took the exposure of the PSL for Asif Ali to come to prominence in an Islamabad United side that owed much to him for their title-winning campaign in 2018. A six in a Super Over against Mustafizur Rahman got their campaign up and running, and it wasn't until he smashed three sixes in arrow in a nerve-wracking chase that his side were assured victory. "
Shaheen Shah Afridi,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother."
Haris Rauf,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,
KL Rahul,India,Right hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"A tall, elegant right-hand batsman who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batsmen in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final."
Rohit Sharma(c),India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20."
Virat Kohli,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them."
Suryakumar Yadav,India,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140."
Axar Patel,India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58."
Hardik Pandya,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Hardik Pandya swears by living life king size and that exuberance finds expression in his powerful hitting in the middle order and brisk seam bowling. He first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2015, but displayed greater consistency in the Syed Mushtaq Ali domestic T20 tournament in January 2016. He finished as the leading run-getter, for Baroda, with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85. "
Dinesh Karthik,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Not many would forget the sight of Dinesh Karthik in India colours, horizontal on the ground, as he stumped Michael Vaughan in 2004. It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. "
Ravichandran Ashwin,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century."
Bhuvneshwar Kumar,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.Â "
Arshdeep Singh,India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,
Mohammed Shami,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. "
Naseem Shah,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited may not be an esteemed name in Pakistan cricket, but it was for this deparment that Naseem Shah made his first-class debut at 15. With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap. "
Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Nazmul Hossain Shanto emerged from an unusual source in Bangladesh cricket - the schools. A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladesh's Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016."
Soumya Sarkar,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Middle order Batter,"A rarity among Bangladesh allrounders, top-order batter Soumya Sarkar bowls medium pace rather than spin, and occasionally even takes the new ball. "
Litton Das,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,Liton Das is the first wicketkeeper-batsman in Bangladesh considered good enough to be a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim. His domestic exploits for Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League and Rangpur Division in the National Cricket League in the 2014-15 season earned him recognition and later a call-up in the senior side for the Test against India in Fatullah in June 2015.
Shakib Al Hasan(c),Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams."
Afif Hossain,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Bangladesh left-hander Afif Hossain made his T20I debut in 2017 and impressed right away in his second game with a 26-ball 52 at No. 8 in a narrow win over Zimbabwe. He took a while to get going after that, although his T20I captain Mahmudullah praised his maturity during a tricky innings on a turning Mirpur pitch. In February 2022 in Chattogram, 22-year-old Afif rescued Bangladesh from 45 for 6 in a record stand with Mehidy Hasan Miraz against Afghanistan - they added an unbeaten 174, the second-highest partnership for the seventh wicket or lower in ODIs. Afif is also the youngest T20 debutant to take a five-for - he was 17 years and 72 days when he picked up 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, for Rajshahi Kings against Chittagong Vikings in December 2016."
Yasir Ali,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,
Nurul Hasan,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Nurul Hasan, who made his first-class debut in 2011, is one of a whole host of talented Bangladesh wicketkeepers who had to wait his turn to play international cricket. It wasn't entirely his fault though. For 30 years, the position behind the stumps was the domain of Khaled Mashud or Mushfiqur Rahim. "
Mosaddek Hossain,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mosaddek Hossain, who comes from a family of cricketers, snuck up on Bangladesh cricket's consciousness during the 2013 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, helping Abahani Limited stay afloat in a disastrous campaign. He struck a century and three fifties, before having to head to the Bangladesh Under-19 training camp ahead of the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. The opportunity to get out of age-group cricket quite early proved to be an important milestone in his development. "
Taskin Ahmed,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Even before he was anywhere near making his international debut, Taskin Ahmed became an internet sensation. A video of his spell against England Under-19s in 2012 found its way to Youtube, and the sight of a Bangladeshi fast bowler ripping it past batsman and hitting the wicketkeeper's gloves quite hard and high made people curious."
Hasan Mahmud,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Hasan Mahmud is one among a group of young pace bowlers who have given hope of a fast bowling uprising in Bangladesh, after decades of reliance on spin. Mahmud is still at a very early stage of his career, having just played a single T20I for Bangladesh, and earned a maiden call-up in the ODI side in January 2021, but already he has earned plenty of praise from Bangladesh's coaches for his ability to bowl fast, full and accurately.

Mustafizur Rahman,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. "
Fionn Hand,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowling Allrounder,
George Munsey,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"Known as the reverse-sweeping demon of the Associate world, George Munsey's path to the Scotland national team is as unorthodox as his trademark shot. Born and raised in Oxford, Munsey had dreams of becoming a professional golfer and it was a golf scholarship to the Loretto School, just outside Edinburgh, that brought him to Scotland at age 13. "
Michael Jones,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,Durham Academy youngster Michael Jones hit 87 in a fine debut for Scotland against Ireland in Dubai as his more experienced team-mates toiled. That breakthrough was followed by a first team debut for Durham against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in June of that year.
Matthew Cross,Scotland,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A wicketkeeper-batter from Aberdeen, Matthew Cross got into the Scotland set-up at U-13 level, progressed up the ranks, making a good impression as vice-captain for the U-19s in the 2012 World Cup in Australia, and then broke into the senior side the following year."
Richie Berrington(c),Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Top order Batter,"Richie Berrington powered Scotland to their long-awaited first victory over an ICC Full Member when his century, which was made in only 56 balls and included five sixes, set-up victory over Bangladesh in a T20 international in July 2012"
Calum MacLeod,Scotland,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium fast, Right arm Offbreak",Top order Batter,"Calum MacLeod won a place in Scottish sport folklore when he struck a century that helped Scotland beat the world's No. 1 ODI side at the time, England, in a game in Edinburgh in 2018. That year, he also produced an unbeaten 157 against Afghanistan in a World Cup Qualifier match in Bulawayo, where he expertly dealt with legspinner Rashid Khan, liberally employing a sweep shot that he put down to his time spent playing hockey. Those knocks made him a slam-dunk choice at the end of 2018 to claim the ICC Associate Player of the Year Award, making him the second Scotland player to do so following Preston Mommsen in 2014. "
Michael Leask,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

Shamarh Brooks,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Top order Batter,"In full flow, Shamarh Brooks is all elegance. He drives mercilessly through the off side and often finishes his flicks standing on one leg. But it took four innings in Tests before these skills were visible."
Mark Watt,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Mark Watt drew attention to himself in no uncertain terms when he took three wickets at The Grange as Scotland overturned England, who were top of the worlds rankings at the time, in an ODI for the first time."
Brad Wheal,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Brad Wheal, a right-handed batsman and right-arm pace bowler, was born in Durban, South Africa but holds a British passport and moved to England with the encouragement of Hampshire's head coach at the time, Dale Benkenstein, who had spotted him playing for Natal Under-19. "
Josh Davey,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Josh Davey's seam-bowling talent was recognised when Middlesex gave him his county debut at the age of 19. But, although he was involved with the county for four years, the seam-bowling allrounder failed to push on, and he was released at the end of 2013 and moved west to Somerset. "
Safyaan Sharif,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Born in Huddersfield, Safyaan Sharif made his debut for Scotland at 20 after eye-catching performances for Dunfermline and Scotland U-19s, and took 4 for 27 against the Netherlands in his first ODI in 2011. With 14 wickets at 23.92 apiece, his fast-medium bowling played an important part in Scotland's success in the World Cup Qualifiers in New Zealand in 2014. "
Quinton de Kock,South Africa,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career. By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa. "
Temba Bavuma(c),South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Middle order Batter,"From the same street in Langa, a township outside Cape Town, where Thami Tsolekile and Malusi Siboto were raised, came Temba Bavuma. Unlike the wicketkeeper-batsman and medium-pacer, Bavuma is a specialist batsman and the first black African batsman picked in South Africa's Test squad. "
Kagiso Rabada,South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. "
Wayne Parnell,South Africa,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"An aggressive left-handed seamer, who bowls with as much venom as he bats, Wayne Parnell was earmarked for success early and spent the next few years trying to get there. Inconsistency and injury were his nemeses, however, and that led to him abandoning international cricket with South Africa and signing a three-year deal with Worcestershire as a Kolpak after the 2018 English season."
Lungi Ngidi,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A tall, imposing paceman, Lungi Ngidi can reach speeds in the 140s kph and is as comfortable opening the bowling as he is at the death, making him one of South Africa's most promising prospects. Ngidi was schooled at Kwa-Zulu Natal's Hilton College and was involved at every provincial age-group level from Under-13 upwards. "
Keshav Maharaj,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"A left-arm spinner from Northwood Boys High, the alma mater of Shaun Pollock, Keshav Maharaj emerged at a time when South Africa began to take spin seriously. For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer."
Anrich Nortje,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Anrich Nortje is a genuine quick who has been described as ""extremely exciting"" by none other than Dale Steyn. Like Steyn, Nortje is not a product of a big city but comes from the town of Uitenhage, north of Port Elizabeth, which is home to the largest Volkswagen factory in the African continent. It's hardly surprising then, that Nortje is well-acquainted with speed. He regularly sends the speed gun over 150kph and has a fearsome bouncer. "
Timm van der Gugten,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Timm van der Gugten, born in Sydney, made his first-class debut for New South Wales in November 2011. He was called up to the Netherlands the following year for World Twenty20 in the West Indies and made his debut at 21.

Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010."
Glenn Phillips,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Glenn Phillips is a top-order wicketkeeper-batsman who has impressed in white-ball cricket during the early stages of his career.

He made his List A debut at the age of 18 before playing in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup. He really started to turn heads, however, during the 2016-17 Super Smash when he was the tournament's leading scorer with 369 runs, including an innings of 116 off 57 balls. He was called into the New Zealand T20 squad to face South Africa in February 2017 after an injury to Martin Guptill.

James Neesham,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. "
Tim David,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mumbai Indians' decision to sign Tim David for INR 8.25 crore (AUD 1.5 million) at the 2022 IPL auction confirmed two things. Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months."
Matthew Wade,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade as he went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batsman to T20I World Cup winning wicketkeeper/finisher via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over.
Adam Zampa,Australia,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,"An energetic and competitive legspinner, Adam Zampa emerged in Australia's limited-overs squads in 2016 after a successful summer for South Australia and the Melbourne Stars. In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."
Trent Boult,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions."
Tim Southee,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes."
Mitchell Santner,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"A left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner was first elevated to the New Zealand side after a promising 2014-15 domestic season. "
Lockie Ferguson,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A right-arm quick with a good bouncer, it is Lockie Ferguson's speed that made a breakout star at the 2019 World Cup in England. Regularly hitting 150kph, Ferguson's raw speed bowling first change yielded 21 wickets at just 19.47 and an economy rate of 4.88. He finished second on the tournament wicket tally behind Mitchell Starc. He was rewarded with being named in the ICC's team of the tournament alongside skipper Kane Williamson. "
Ish Sodhi,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"There is little in Ish Sodhi's statistics to suggest he is an international-quality legspinner, but New Zealand's selectors have seen enough in his aggressive approach and keen attitude to hand him a Test debut after only one full season of first-class cricket. Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhi's journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds."
Aryan Lakra,U.A.E.,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Stephan Myburgh,Netherlands,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,
Brandon Glover,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A Dutch-South African fast bowler, Brandon Glover left South Africa after a call from Netherlands coach Ryan Campbell, who convinced him to put his Dutch passport to good use after he had finished his accounting degree. He had played Under-19 cricket for South Africa, but was enticed by the opportunity to play regular international cricket, and starred at the T20 World Cup Qualifier in late 2019, bowling hard lengths into the pitch at high pace."
Shoriful Islam,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"At 6ft three inches, Shoriful Islam became a left-arm pace sensation almost overnight, when he starred in Bangladesh's 2020 Under-19 World Cup triumph. He took nine wickets, but it was his aggression and pace in the knockout games against South Africa, New Zealand and (in the final against) India that stood out."
Daryl Mitchell,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Daryl Mitchell was called into New Zealand's Test team in late 2019 as a replacement for the injured Colin de Grandhomme. He impressed, too, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. He had made his international debut against India in a T20I in February of that year."
Kasun Rajitha,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Virtually unheard of before 2015, the first inkling of right-arm seamer Kasun Rajitha's potential came during a three-dayer against the touring Indians in August of that year. He took 5 for 68 on a spicy Khettarama deck in that match, dismissing Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in a single spell, before claiming Kohli's wicket in the second innings as well."
Deepak Hooda,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction. "
Rilee Rossouw,South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"A stylish top-order player with an elegant and authoritative drive, Rilee Rossouw has been a high-impact batter for South Africa in limited-overs cricket.  "
Aiden Markram,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"The first South Africa captain to win a World Cup, albeit at age-group level, Aiden Markram announced himself as champion material early. He led South Africa's Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. "
David Miller,South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"A hard-hitting left-hander with a penchant for clearing the boundary, David Miller made famous the phrase ""If it's in the arc, it's out the park."" Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder. "
Tristan Stubbs,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,
Nasum Ahmed,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Mohammad Haris,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,
Mohammad Wasim,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Allrounder,
Ebadot Hossain,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Ebadat Hossain Chowdhury's journey from being a volleyball player for Bangladesh Air Force to becoming a Test cricketer in February 2019 was a short, and interesting, one. Living in their barracks, Ebadat dreamt of bowling like Brett Lee one day. His dream came true when he took part in the 2016 Robi Pacer Hunt in Faridpur, crisscrossing 342km southwest from his hometown Sylhet. He was one of the top three bowlers, and was duly picked by the scouts to a training camp in Dhaka."
Heinrich Klaasen,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A clean-hitting, wicketkeeper batsman, Heinrich Klaasen emerged on the scene at the same time that Quinton de Kock nailed down a place in the South African team, across all formats. As someone who had always combined the disciplines of batting and glovework, Klaasen hoped to make it in either skill and establish himself as all-round option, if required."
Brad Evans,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Allrounder,
Fakhar Zaman,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,"Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."
Cameron Green,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Batting Allrounder,"Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, Cameron Green took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. "
Steven Smith,Australia,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Middle order Batter,"In a career of twists and turns, Steven Smith started out as a legspinner and become Australia's best batter since Sir Donald Bradman, either side of having his career derailed by a ball-tampering scandal that saw him stripped of the captaincy and banned for 12 months."
Matthew Wade(c),Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade as he went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batsman to T20I World Cup winning wicketkeeper/finisher via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over.
Kane Richardson,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A pace bowler who has often been on the fringes of Australia's ODI and T20 teams, Kane Richardson is know for his skills at the death and has an excellent yorker. Although he has struggled to gain much traction at first-class level for South Australia, Richardson is very effective in the shorter forms and in 2019 was a late addition to the World Cup squad."
Gulbadin Naib,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Gulbadin Naib's first love in the sporting world was amateur bodybuilding, not cricket. When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage."
Darwish Rasooli,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,
Naveen-ul-Haq,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,
Rishabh Pant,India,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team."
Tony Munyonga,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,
Wellington Masakadza,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Tabraiz Shamsi,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"A left-arm wristspin bowler with ample variations and a good googly, Tabraiz Shamsi emerged as South Africa were starting to warm to the wave of spinners being produced at domestic levels, although it took a while for him to come through. "
Phil Salt,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."
Chris Jordan,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Chris Jordan, a fast bowler with a level-headed calmness and a fearsome yorker, found his niche as a death specialist in T20 cricket for England after initially breaking through as a bowling allrounder in Tests and ODIs. "
Regis Chakabva(c),Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A doughty wicketkeeper-batsman, Regis Chakabva's path in cricket took him through Highfields, Churchill, on to Takashinga, provincial cricket and eventually regular appearances in Zimbabwe's Twenty20, ODI and Test teams. At each level, Chakabva has improved his game and he is maturing into a fine batsman and tidy wicketkeeper."
Mehidy Hasan Miraz,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mehedi Hasan Miraz has emerged as one of the brightest young stars in Bangladesh cricket. He led the country to their first appearance in an Under-19 World Cup semi-final in February 2016, before making the year more memorable with his Test debut, against England in October."
